# VSI-Security-Monitoring-Project
This week, you will work in groups to use the skills that you've learned in the Defensive Security unit and design a custom monitoring environment to protect a fictional organization, VSI. On Day 1, you'll use Splunk to research and design a monitoring solution for the fictional organization. On Day 2, you'll determine whether that monitoring solution will protect the organization from several simulated attacks. On Day 3, you'll showcase your defensive project with a group presentation to the class.



Day 1:
You will work with your group to develop a defensive solution in order to protect the mock organization. You will receive logs of “normal” business functions in order to understand the organization's environment. You will use these logs to create baselines and then design custom alerts, reports, and dashboards. You will additionally have the opportunity to download and use a Splunk "add-on" app of your choice to monitor against a type of attack.



Day 2:
You will work with your group to determine whether the monitoring solutions that you designed on Day 1 protected VSI against attacks from their adversary JobeCorp. Additionally, you will create a short presentation showcasing the work that you completed on Day 1 and Day 2, which you'll present to the class on Day 3.



Day 3:
You will conclude your project by presenting your monitoring environment and attack analysis to your classmates.
